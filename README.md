# Web Scraping Job Postings (Practice Job Board)

This project simulates the work of a junior data analyst at a recruitment agency. 
The goal is to improve job vacancy sourcing by automatically collecting and analyzing job postings from a structured job board.

## 🧠 What I Practiced
- Web scraping with `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`
- HTML structure inspection
- Data cleaning with pandas
- Location parsing (city/state)
- Keyword extraction
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data visualization with matplotlib
- Saving clean datasets to CSV
- Structuring a reproducible data pipeline

## 📊 Key Insights
- Top hiring companies identified through frequency counts  
- Most active cities with multiple reported openings  
- Strong demand for engineering and Python-related roles  
- Low presence of senior-level job postings  

## 📁 Project Files
- `web_scraping_job_postings.ipynb` — Full Python notebook
- `job_postings_fake_job.csv` — Final structured dataset

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Replace practice site with a real job API (e.g., Arbeitnow Job Board API)
- Add NLP keyword extraction (spaCy)
- Deploy a dashboard (Looker Studio or Streamlit)
